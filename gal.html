                          <p> 
                          Often interchangeable with the term “taper”, a fade simply means you want the hair on the side of your head to gradually get shorter from top to bottom. The process of fading from one length to another is generally achieved using hair clippers. Because the fade comes in a variety of styles, it is important to tell your barber the type of fade haircut you need.</p>
